# Content Folder

## Overview

This is where content goes. According to nanoc, content files are called "items". So this is where all the "items" are. When nanoc compiles, it turns these files into HTML files and copies them to the /output directory according to certain rules.

## Rules

The basic rule is that a file named '[file].markdown' compiled into an HTML file called 'index.html' and copied to a folder called 'output/[file]'.
